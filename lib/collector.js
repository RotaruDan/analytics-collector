/**
 *
 * This class exports a function that returns an object with two methods used to
 * start collecting data and to actually track incoming data.
 *
 * This class encapsulates the authorization process and anonymous player creation.
 *
 * The process of sending data is the following:
 *
 *      1 - Invoke 'start' with a valid tracking code. Include <Content-Type, application/json> header if you want to send a body.
 *          1.1 - If you want to be an Anonymous user, just invoke start. Also, if you want to re-use an Anonymous user and create another
 *               session, you can send the body: { "anonymous" : "player_id" }.
 *          1.2 - If you want authorized users, after they login into A2 and obtain the user token, you have to include an authorization
 *                header with the user token that you've. <Authorization, Bearer user_token>.
 *      2 - You receive a response with the authorization token, player id, player name (as animal name), a session counter, the actor that
 *          you have to include in xAPI traces, the objectId that goes after every xAPI object identifier, and the date of the first session
 *          and current session.
 *      3 - Use the authorization token received as a header in the following requests.
 *      4 - The headers format must be <Authorization, auth_token_received>
 *      5 - You can send data to be tracked and consumed by the configured consumers. Currently
 *      there are only two consumers.
 *              5.1 - OpenLRS consumer: sends the received data to an LRS. This means that the received data
 *                                    must be xAPI v 1.0.1 compliant (https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md)
 *                                    in order to avoid errors from the LRS.
 *              5.2 - Kafka consumer: all the data is also queued using Kafka to a Storm cluster in order to preform some
 *                                  real time analysis and extract the real time state of the game.
